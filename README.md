## My journey so far

As a self-driven programmer, I've embraced the journey of learning by doing. Every skill I've acquired has been through hands-on experience, tackling problems head-on and unraveling the mysteries as I go.

### Check out my repos!

- :muscle: One of my standout projects is Paps-Bot, a Discord bot that was a fantastic learning experience. Wrestling with data handling and saving bot data to a database was both challenging and rewarding.

- :hammer: Currently, I'm immersed in crafting a DnD 3.5 Digital Character Sheet. This project showcases a full-stack solution for managing your character sheets efficiently!
