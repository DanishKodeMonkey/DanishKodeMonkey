### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel, an aspiring full stack developer, with a fondness for front-end developement, and backend problem solving.

I am currently searching for opportunities to start a professional career with programming, developing front-end solutions and growing as a programmer.

I am a self-learning programmer looking to establish myself in the industry as a professional. 
Everything I've learned, I've learned by doing, diving head first and figuring it out as I go.

While I have a fondness for developing front-end solutions, I have a invested interest in the workings of backend solutions, and the problem solving of making front- and backend work together.

I'm currently working on a little project involving a digital Dungeons and Dragons character sheet, for managing and holding your characters information for use in real life
tabletop sessions. 

This includes working a React-bootstrap solution on the front end side, with custom Javascript components to handle the math of the character statistics
as well as a backend solution using MongoDB, to store and manage Json files of the compiled character data.

It's a learning experience, and I usually start projects like this with frameworks and components that I haven't used much before, and learn as I go.

I already got a good grasp on HTMl, CSS, Javascript, And react for frontend solutions, as well as Python as a backend solution for automation, and SQL for database management.

I'm always open to learn, share experiences, and receive future opportunities

I can mainly be reached by email @ Daniel_Runge_@hotmail.com
