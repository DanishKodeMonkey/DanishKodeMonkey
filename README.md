### Hi there! :wave:

My name is Daniel, an aspiring full stack developer with a fondness for front-end developement, and backend problem solving.

- I am currently searching for opportunities to start a professional career with programming, developing front-end solutions, handling backend problem solving, and growing as a programmer.

- I am a self-learning programmer looking to establish myself in the industry as a professional. 
- Everything I've learned, I've learned by doing, diving head first and figuring it out as I go.
Always curious for the next challenge, framework, language or problem to be solved.

### Check out my repos!

- :muscle: I am especially proud of my work with the [discord bot paps-bot](https://github.com/zanderhavgaard/paps-bot/), a great learning experience wrestling with data handling, saving data from a bot to a database.

- :hammer: Currently I'm working on a [DnD 3.5 digital character sheet](https://github.com/DanishKodeMonkey/dnd-charactersheet), utilising a full stack solution to handle your character sheets!
