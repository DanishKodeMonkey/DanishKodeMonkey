## My journey so far

As a self-driven programmer, I've embraced the journey of learning by doing. Every skill I've acquired has been through hands-on experience, tackling problems head-on and unraveling the mysteries as I go.

### Check out my repos!

- :muscle: One of my standout projects is my message board prototype, a great exercise in building a message board from scratch using Bootstrap for styling the front end, express and nodejs for the backend, and mongoDB as the database, a fun full stack demo! [check it out!](https://coffee-lovers-club.fly.dev/messageboard)

- :hammer: Currently, I'm hammering through a fascinating full stack curriculum called [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to enhance, and expand on my super powers in order to grow stronger!
